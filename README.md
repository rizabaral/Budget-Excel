# Budget-Excel
Hi Guys,
I have created a budget tracking using Excel sheet.
I have used Waterfall chart for income breakdown which shows increase and decrease of the income.
For Expenses, I have used Funnel and Pyramid chart by sorting with different colors on expenses.
And Doughnut chart for Expenses percentage.
